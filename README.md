# max_min_2D_array

This repository contains two programs written in the C programming language that demonstrate how to find the maximum and minimum elements of a two-dimensional array. The purpose of these programs is to showcase two different approaches to achieve the same goal: one program utilizes arrays, while the other program leverages pointers.

## Program Descriptions

### Program using Arrays
The program named `max_min_array.c` demonstrates how to find the maximum and minimum elements in a two-dimensional array by utilizing array data structures. It provides a clear example of how to iterate through the array, compare the elements, and keep track of the maximum and minimum values. The program's logic is implemented using array indexing and basic conditional statements.

### Program using Pointers
The program named `max_min_pointers.c` showcases an alternative approach to finding the maximum and minimum elements in a two-dimensional array by utilizing pointers. It illustrates how to traverse the array using pointers, compare the elements, and update the maximum and minimum values accordingly. This program demonstrates the flexibility and power of pointers in C programming.

## How to Use the Programs
Both programs are written in C and can be compiled and executed using a C compiler such as GCC or Clang. Simply navigate to the respective program's file in your preferred development environment or terminal, and follow the steps below:

1. Compile the program:
   ```
   gcc max_min_array.c -o max_min_array
   ```

   ```
   gcc max_min_pointers.c -o max_min_pointers
   ```

2. Execute the program:
   ```
   ./max_min_array
   ```

   ```
   ./max_min_pointers
   ```

   The programs will prompt you to input the dimensions of the two-dimensional array and its elements. After the computations are performed, the output will display the maximum and minimum values found in the array.
